## Summary

In 2015, despite not being a member state of the UN, the State of Palestine committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. One of the goals of the New Urban Agenda is outlined below:

> "**Take action to address climate change by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions"**
>
> Leaders have committed to involve not just the local government but all actors of society to take climate action taking into account the Paris Agreement on climate change which seeks to limit the increase in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Sustainable cities that reduce emissions from energy Â and build resilience can play a lead role."

In a report documenting their progress in implementing the New Urban Agenda from 2016 - 2021, Palestine outlines the progress made on each development theme. Under "Resilience, Mitigation and Adaptation of Cities and Human Settlements", one of the goals is:

> **3.1.2 Implement climate change mitigation and adaptation actions**
>
> **3.1.2.b** **Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)**

High air pollution in Palestinian territories can be attributed to rapid urbanisation, the improper management of solid waste, and a growing population, much of whom rely on motor vehicles to get around due to a limited access to alternative forms of transportation. These consequences are both environmental and social, having negative impacts on liveability, quality of life, and health outcomes (including respiratory diseases, serious immune system disorders, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and lung cancer).

In terms of progress on this goal, the report states:

> **Neither government authorities nor LGUs track the levels of the fine PM as part of a comprehensive system**, although authorities including major municipalities **acknowledge the importance of monitoring air pollution** including the levels of the fine PM especially at proximity of industrial zones and quarries, in addition to various topographic locations so as to provide specific and macro-level indications about the impact of factories and transborder activities.

It's clear from this report that monitoring air pollution in the spatial dimension is of high importance to the State of Palestine, but they lack a systematic way to do so.

## Applications

The state has been experiencing a lack of funding due to both international aid declining significantly since 2019 and Israel's witholding of tax revenue. This means that any strategies we propose must be low cost. On ground monitoring would provide reliable air quality measurements, but require costly infrastructure, installation, and management. The use of satellite imagery to map particulate matter (PM) concentrations has been well studied in recent years.

**Data and** **Methods**

Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is widely used to measure near-surface atmospheric PM. It is a measure of the amount of light scattered or absorbed by aerosol particles in the atmosphere. We will use imagery from MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), which provides AOD measurements at a daily temporal resolution.

@zhangSatelliteRemoteSensing2021 summarises and compares the various methods for satellite-based PM concentration mapping developed in the field over the past 20 years. The authors assessed the advantages and disadvantages of 4 different common methods:

In their discussion, they suggest a combination of the first 3 methods: **univariate regression**, **CTM-based**, and **multivariate statistical**.

The **land use regression model (LUR)** is another method that can be employed in urban areas. It uses variables like land use, traffic, population density, and other geographic factors around the site as predictors for PM concentration. @liuLandUseRegression2016 applied this method in Shanghai without using any satellite AOD data and achieved an R\^2 of 0.88. We can test a hybrid model using LUR with one or multiple of the methods mentioned above and find that which achieves the highest predictive accuracy for our mapping.

Once we have this model, we can use **seasonal decomposition** to see how pollution varies throughout seasons of the year. We can also conduct a **time series analysis** to assess how it changes day-to-day over the course of a week.

**Recommended usages**

This data will allow planners and policy makers to understand the extent of impact that factories, quarries, and transborder activities have on air quality. They can also see where motor vehicles and improper waste management practices have the largest effects. They can use this information to target interventions in the areas with the highest exposure. Interventions could include assigning which cars can drive on which days (a successful strategy adopted by other cities including Paris and Beijing), keeping housing development away from industrial zones, implementing new waste management strategies or increasing education around the environmental impact of trash incineration. They can also use this data to (1) expose the environmental and health impacts that the illegal occupation is causing, and (2) apply pressure on international community for more aid and support.

**Future Recommendations**

Eventually a real-time air quality monitoring system would be ideal so that they implement strategies in real time, however given the limited funds, it is more feasible first step to model the spatial and temporal concentrations of PM using historical data. In the future, using data from geostationary satellites (which orbit around the equator at the same speed as earth) which have a higher temporal resolution could be a way to get closer to developing real-time monitoring system.

## Reflection

The spatial and political arrangement of Palestine, specifically in the West Bank, presents a unique challenge to urban planning and climate mitigation strategies for many reasons. One is the lack of sovereignty over certain areas which implies an inability to implement desired strategies. Another is the fragmentation and lack of contiguity between territories --- enclaves are surrounded by Israeli occupied territory and are thus exposed to the air pollution produced in those areas, especially close to the borders. Particulate matter is able to travel long distances, meaning that the Palestinian population could be exposed to pollution from activities occurring in areas that are not under Palestinian jurisdiction (i.e. Israel or Area C territories which are Israeli controlled and occupied).

This practical showed me how necessary it is to understand of the specific political, economic, social, and spatial characteristics of a region when coming up with effective solutions. One-size-fits all solutions do not exist and there is no universal strategy that can be implemented in every city!
