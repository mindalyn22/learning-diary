# Hello! {.unnumbered}

My name is Mindy and I'm a Master's student of Urban Spatial Science in the Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA). My background is in web development and data engineering. This year, I'm taking a module called: [CASA0023: Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/00-course_info.html) which covers the processing techniques, analysis methods, and practical applications of remotely sensed data.

This book documents my weekly learning journey through the module. Navigate through each week using the menu on the left side.
