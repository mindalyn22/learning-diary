# Hello! {.unnumbered}

My name is Mindy and I'm a Master's student of Urban Spatial Science in the Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA). My background is in web development (full stack) and data engineering.

This book is made to document my weekly learning journey through [CASA0023: Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023/00-course_info.html). Navigate through each week using the menu on the left side.
