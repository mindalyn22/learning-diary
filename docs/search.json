A few of these bands are visible to us (Red, Blue, and Green), but most aren’t.\n\n\n\nSpectral Signatures\n\n\nSensors produce a digital number which represents the amount of energy collected by the sensor. A raw image is a 2D matrix where each pixel represents the raw DN value (one for each band i think). We have to convert these values into radiance, then into reflectance (2 types: top of atmosphere and bottom of atmosphere aka surface reflectance). Surface reflectance is the true property of the object (ratio of energy reflected by the object. The DN values are not the true value because the sensor might capture different amounts of energy on different days based on weather conditions.\nThe spectral signature is also known as the spectral reflectance. It shows the reflectance ratio for each band (wavelength) for the feature. We know we’re getting the surface reflectance because the data we took from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 products have been processed to provide BOA surface reflectance. If a band has a low reflectance value it means that that surface type is absorbing the energy (like water absorbs almost all infrared waves, whereas vegetation highly reflects infrared). Vegetation looks green to us because it reflects a lot of green light.\nDifferent sensors might give slightly different spectral signatures for the same area of the earth’s surface. This is because they may have different spectral resolutions/sensitivity. The practical is about comparing spectral signatures between Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 data.\n\n\n\n\nI chose to look at a region of Singapore for this practical.\nbands \nColor Composites (1) True Colour Composite (B1=Blue, B2=Green, B3=Red) [insert image]  (2) False Color Composite (B8, B4, B3) - Plants reflect near-infrared and green light whilst absorbing red.  (3) Atmospheric Penetration Composite - B12, B11, B8A with no visible bands to penetrate atmospheric particles. Vegetation = blue, urban area = white, gray cyan or purple.  (4) Short-wave Infrared Composite (B12, B8A and B4) - shows vegetation in green, the darker the greener the denser it is and brown shows built up or bare soil …and there are more\nSpectral Feature Space - Wizard/Tasseled Cap - x axis (brightness): B4 (red) - vegetation absorbs - y axis (greenness): B8 (near infrared reflectance) - vegetation reflects  \nTasseled Cap Function: A way of transforming original data to new data with reduced dimensionality (using PCA - reducing dimensions while maximising variance). Brightness, associated with spectral bands that show bare soil, man made surfaces or bight materials Greenness, associated with green vegetation Wetness, associated with moisture"

    "text": "2.1 Applications\nEnvironmental Application: A study was done to assess water quality by looking for particular algae. The researchers asked what is the spectral reflectivity of this type of algae in this type of water? They use a spectroscope to emit electromagnetic radiation onto the aglae and to get the spectral signature. Then when assessing water images, can then search for pixels that are similar to this spectral signature. They write a program to find every pixel that has a a reflectivity of x in the infrared band, a reflectivity of y in the red band, …etc. (Rundquist et. al, 1996)\nMilitary application: Camouflaging equipment in colors (making them green to hide in trees, but not camouflaging in infrared would mean that if something flew over with infrared sensors, they could be detected. Mentioned in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j4sH7pkE&ab_channel=Boldbayar.R\nHow can we differentiate between similar looking surfaces? If you have a higher spectral resolution (chop it up into finer bands), you can better differentiate between things that might look similar (like oak tree vs an elm tree, grass vs astroturf)\n (Lillesane et al., 2015)"

    "text": "2.2 Reflection\nThere is so much more to remote sensing than I expected. I had a really basic idea that there were just satellites that took pictures from outer space but I didn’t realise how so many different lengths of electromagnetic waves, beyond those which are visible to us, can give us different types of information.\nI’m interested in the use of these spectral signatures in identifying building materials as I think that could have really useful applications in climate and sustainability. I thought about this article I read from Bloomberg CityLab that assessed heat islands in major cities in relation to the concentration of specific materials and colors (clay buildings and white paint being cooler while concrete was hotter)."
